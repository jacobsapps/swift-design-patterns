# Abstract Factory

## Intent 
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Use when 
- A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented 
- A system should be configured with one of several possible families of related products 
- A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and this constraint should be enforced 
- You want to provide a class library of products, and only reveal their interfaces
